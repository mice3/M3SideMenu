M3SideMenu
==========
a little Objective C side navigation view, that we created for a certain project.
The view is separated into 3 segments: 
- top: extendable table view with add/remove cell functionalities 
- middle: navigation buttons, the view resizes itself depending on the button count) 
- bottom: custom view template (e.g. profile picture) 
 
Each of the three segments can be disabled/hidden, which will make the others adjust their sizes accordingly
